Some very small nations (Pacific micro-states, or city-states like Vatican City, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino) don't have that many distinctly documented dishes to draw from. For those, this atlas lists what can genuinely be confirmed and says so plainly, rather than padding the count with invented or generic filler.",
